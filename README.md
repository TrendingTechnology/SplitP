# SplitP 
![](https://github.com/js51/SplitP/workflows/build/badge.svg)

Python package which implements split-based and rank-based phylogenetic tools and methods.

The latest version of SplitP can be installed via the command
`pip install SplitP`

Code written to perform the simulations and analysis outlined in my honours thesis is available in the `examples` folder.

The current to-do list:
* Convert the testing code on my local machine to PyTest code and improve test coverage.
* Make the code in the examples folder more clear and concise.
* Publish documentation.
* Convert tree implementation to use NetworkX.
